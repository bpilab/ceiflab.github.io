            <p>Anthropogenic carbon emissions have resulted in a major increase in atmospheric levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases, especially methane. This is leading to global warming, through the greenhouse effect and acidification of the oceans. There is therefore a pressing need to reduce future emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases. In line with this, the UK government have a plan to become net zero by 2050; the University of Cambridge plan to become net zero by 2048. Net zero means that there is no net emission of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-carbon-emissions">Reducing carbon emissions</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ccs-project.jpg" alt="Carbon storage site" /></p>

<p>Reaching net zero is a major challenge, requiring a re-building of much of the national and international energy infrastructure, and has challenges in the supply and use of energy. The supply needs to change from oil, gas and coal to carbon free sources, which with today’s technologies largely implies new wind and solar power – future technologies may also unlock more of the potential energy in waves, such as tidal and geothermal. Presently over 80% of the world’s energy usage is supplied by fossil fuels, so the transition in the energy supply system is of a truly global scale. While this occurs, energy supply needs to be maintained; given the scale of the transition it is very likely that we will continue to use a significant but gradually diminishing inventory of fossil fuels, as the new renewable supplies come on stream. This future use of fossil fuels will release a substantial amount of greenhouse gases; technologies to reduce these emissions by making fuel production or consumption more efficient will therefore have an important impact on the overall atmospheric carbon levels.</p>

<h3 id="technological-challenges">Technological challenges</h3>

<p><img src="/images/engine-diagram-narrow.png" alt="Diagram of an engine" /></p>

<p>The demand for energy spans many different uses, such as heating (for buildings), electricity for power (for use in lighting, powering computers, and other electrical goods), and energy for transport (cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes). Presently, in the UK 22 million homes use natural gas for heating; transitioning to a carbon free heating system will require replacement of all the gas boilers with other systems, such as electrical heat pumps or hydrogen driven heating systems. Transport is centred on petrol and diesel powered cars and trucks, jet fuel for planes and coke for shipping; we need new vehicles powered by carbon free energy sources. Electrical cars provide a replacement for petrol/diesel cars, but large trucks, with substantially greater mass and hence energy needs, may require alternative high density energy sources, such as hydrogen, and there are experiments under way exploring the use of hydrogen to power ships. Electricity is a direct product of wind and solar power, so with enough wind turbines and solar farms the electrical systems become zero carbon. In today’s power generation system, wind and solar do not provide all the electricity, and the electricity derived from natural gas is not carbon free; running electric cars or heat pumps on gas-derived electricity does not remove carbon emissions. Hydrogen could be generated from renewable energy using the electricity to electrolyse water, thereby making the hydrogen a zero carbon fuel.</p>

<p>Another major challenge of the energy transition is that as well as requiring new infrastructure for both the supply and the demand systems, the electrical grid which transmits the electricity needs a substantial upgrade and redesign if it is to carry the energy for transport and heating as well as the electricity load for its present uses. For context, in the UK, the energy used at present for electricity, for heating and for transport are of comparable scale.</p>

<p>Owing to the enormity of these challenges, another technology which has been discussed and which is included in the IPCC and the UK Committee for Climate Change plans is the process of <a href="/research/carbon-storage">Carbon Capture and Storage</a>. Carbon Capture and Storage involves the removal of carbon dioxide from the gases produced when fossil fuels are combusted. At a power station, the CO<sub>2</sub> can be captured on a large scale and pumped underground into saline aquifers, where the CO<sub>2</sub> will displace the water and become trapped. CCS provides a means to prevent addition of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere, while still using natural gas or other fossil fuels to generate electricity, leading to the expression “clean gas”. CCS is however an important technology in its own right, since there are other industrial processes which produce large fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub>, such as cement manufacture. Using CCS to capture the large flux of CO<sub>2</sub> produced at a cement factory or other such site would reduce those emissions into the atmosphere. It is also possible to grow biofuels, which absorb CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, and then burn the fuels to produce electricity, while capturing the exhaust gases through CCS. This ultimately leads to negative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>, and has been proposed as part of the net zero system for 2050.</p>

<h3 id="energy-efficiency">Energy efficiency</h3>

<p><img src="/images/st-johns-college.jpg" alt="St John's college" /></p>

<p>Finally, an important element of the energy transition is in designing more efficient systems, from small machines, phones and computers, to larger buildings and other infrastructure. Using less energy while maintaining present functionality offers huge opportunities to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

<p>The BPI is involved in the development of many of the above solutions or topics related to the energy transition. Work is under way to reduce the frictional stresses associated with lubricants, making machines with moving parts more efficient so they use less energy in the first instance. We also have a major programme of research into carbon capture and storage, examining how much CO<sub>2</sub> can be injected into a subsurface aquifer, where it will spread in the aquifer, and how we can monitor where the CO<sub>2</sub> migrates within the aquifer. Other research in the BPI is directed towards designing low energy buildings, while also keeping the environment in such buildings safe and well ventilated. We have projects exploring the production of batteries with higher energy capacity, and in using aquifers to store thermal energy on a seasonal basis. Some research in the BPI is directed towards understanding the detailed processes which occur in nature as a result of the climate change; we have projects exploring the long term evolution is ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic, modelling deep ocean mixing with a view to providing clearer quantification of the residence time of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbed into the ocean, and work modelling avalanches and landslides which are becoming more frequent owing to changes in vegetation and forest fires as well as other effects.</p>

<p>We welcome mutually respectful debate and discussion about the important issues of climate change and the energy transition, and encourage students to sign up for the annual BPI Masterclass in December. The energy challenge requires a very wide cohort of students and faculty to engage with the multitude of problems associated with driving forward the energy transition, ranging from the science and technology to the design of new policy, and the challenges of the social and economic constraints.
