<p>As you will see from the wide range of research, we have a strong interest in helping to understand the science of climate change, including the work on ice dynamics and ocean mixing, and we have many projects related to the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the energy system, where our work is providing important new insights into new technologies, including CCS, energy storage, low energy building design, wind turbine optimisation. We also hold an annual Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand to which all students in Cambridge can apply to attend - at this we have a host of speakers presenting the facts and data about the present and future energy system, in particular focussing on the technology and other challenges associated with decarbonising the energy system.</p>

<p>The energy transition requires a large number of scientists and engineers to work with government, industry and society to try to assess and select optimal solutions for a decarbonised energy system. There are many choices and challenges with developing a decarbonised energy supply system and energy supply mix: it needs to have sufficient capacity to supply the energy which the world uses, both presently and going forward and we need to determine the fraction of this energy supply which each technology might contribute (eg wind or solar or geothermal or hydroelectric, or nuclear, â€¦). Also knowledge of the present energy supply system is clearly very important in informing these decisions. On the demand side, there are very many technical challenges to develop new machines and other systems which can be powered by the new energy supply system, which will be largely delivered as electricity, or perhaps as hydrogen - compared to today, where we have a significant amount of energy delivered to the user in the form of natural gas (eg for heating over 20 million homes in the UK) or in petrol or diesel (for powering vehicles) which need to be replaced with electric vehicles or perhaps hydrogen powered vehicles, and alternative heating systems, which might include district heating systems or heat pumps, or other solutions. There are significant natural resource implications if all passenger vehicles become electric, given the large number of new batteries that we would need to manufacture. We also need new solutions for powering cargo ships and air travel. In addition, there are numerous opportunities for more efficient use of energy through new technological solutions, and better design, especially with buildings. Then the cement and steel industries, which are responsible for a significant fraction of global CO2 emissions, may require the development of CCS and the invention of lower carbon manufacturing processes. Finally, biofuels with carbon capture, offer a possible means to achieve negative emissions.</p>

<p>For all of these problems, there is an enormous amount of important work to be done, on policy and economics as well as the science and engineering, and we are engaged in some of these problems in the BPI. Our hope is that many students and other researchers will join in this major activity to help address both the overarching questions of technology choices moving forward (since there are many different solutions) and the detailed questions which require detailed technical / engineering or research work in each part of the energy system - both relating to the supply and the demand sides, as well as energy efficiency.</p>

<p>As you will appreciate, industry plays a central role in the energy supply and energy demand systems, and so it is crucial that we collaborate and work constructively with industry across the whole spectrum to help translate our technical innovations into creating the new decarbonised energy system, and also to help influence the choices made by industry going forward using our detailed technical knowledge. As the energy infrastructure undergoes this enormous transition, there is a need for civilised discussion and debate, and the BPI as with other venues in the University, provides an ideal platform for such discussions.</p>

<p>We all want to evolve to a decarbonised energy system as rapidly as possible, but this is an enormous endeavour, and it will require tremendous innovation and collaboration.</p>
