<p>The BPI is an interdisciplinary research institute in the University of Cambridge, with a focus on fluid mechanics and surface science. Our research spans subjects ranging from volcano dynamics, carbon sequestration, ocean mixing and ice sheet evolution, through to microscopic encapsulation technology, fundamentals of wetting and corrosion, flow in permeable rocks, and most recently granular flows and fluid mechanics for sustainability and the energy transition. It is characterised by the combination of experimental data, theoretical modelling and numerical analysis to enable quantitative description of many complex and often multiphase flow processes.</p>

<p>The BPI was established in 2000 and has six permanent university faculty, a senior research fellow and a lively cohort of over 30 PhD and Post-Doctoral researchers. We have 5 parent departments in the University: Earth Sciences, Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Engineering.</p>

<h4 id="research-impact">Research Impact</h4>

<p>Over the past 20 years, research from the BPI has had significant impact in a number of key areas, including the design of low energy ventilation systems for buildings, new insights into carbon sequestration, improved functioning of lubricants, and new encapsulation processes for bio-active washing powders.</p>

<h4 id="annual-masterclass">Annual Masterclass</h4>

<p>A flagship enterprise of the BPI is the <a href="events">Annual Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand</a>, which has been running for over 17 years and includes lively debate on the energy transition, including presentations and discussion of the technological challenges associated with various sources of energy and challenges on reducing energy demand.</p>

<p>The BPI was established through an endowment by BP plc in 1999, and over the past 20 years, the BPI has built up very strong links with many partners in both academia and industry, working on problems in the built environment, the energy sector and the environment.</p>
