            <div class="post-content">
            <p>Decarbonisation of the energy system is the greatest challenge we face.
At Cambridge’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows,
world-leading researchers in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and
surface science are working to develop the solutions we need to
replace fossil fuels and protect our planet.</p>

<p>After an extremely hot, dry summer in the UK, where records were broken
once again, many of us are realising that climate change isn’t some
far-off possibility: it’s already here. To protect our planet for
current and future generations, we need solutions now.</p>

<p>There is hope, however: there are options in all sectors to
significantly reduce carbon emissions. Huge cost and efficiency
improvements in wind and solar power are building up the renewable
supply of electricity, but the associated intermittency requires
substantial energy storage infrastructure to replace the gas-fired
power stations which cushion against this intermittency.</p>

<p>Other industries, such as global shipping, aviation, cement,
fertiliser, and iron and steel require radical solutions, including
the possible use of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology.</p>

<p>“We need to transition our economy to low carbon sources of power
as a matter of urgency,” said Professor Andy Woods.
“Universities like Cambridge are working hard to develop the
science and technology to underpin this industrial revolution,
in collaboration with industry.”</p>

<p>Woods is Director of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows
(IEEF). The Institute was established at Cambridge in 2000, and was
initially known as the BP Institute. The IEEF’s researchers work with
academic and industrial collaborators from around the world, using
fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and surface science to help with
some of the major challenges for decarbonisation including
geological carbon storage, superfast battery charging, efficient
building heating systems and lubricants which reduce drag.</p>

<h2 id="developing-solutions-with-industry">Developing solutions with industry</h2>

<p>The Institute’s researchers also study ocean mixing dynamics,
focusing on the timescales of carbon storage, and environmental
challenges including avalanche dynamics and explosive volcanic
eruptions, as well as the fluid mechanical processes controlling
the melting polar ice.</p>

<p>The Institute collaborates on energy transition projects with
energy companies, including BP and Shell, who are investing
heavily in the energy transition, including the development of
wind farms, carbon storage reservoirs, geothermal energy extraction,
and hydrogen production: all of which are key components of a
decarbonised energy system.</p>

<p>“Direct collaboration with industry ensures we can contribute to the
critical technical challenges associated with these energy solutions,”
said Woods. “For example, our work on carbon storage is helping
address both the regulatory and environmental challenges to ensure
safe geological storage, and to maximise the efficiency of the
infrastructure needed for carbon storage.”</p>

<h2 id="storing-co2-underground">Storing CO2 underground</h2>

<p>According to the latest IEA and IPCC projections, to reach the
1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement by 2050, the world needs to
capture and store between 7 and 8 gigatons of CO2 per year,
nearly one-quarter of present global emissions. This will be
sourced from cement, iron and steel, and fertiliser production
as well as from the emerging industry of direct air capture,
including biofuels. Currently, just 40 megatons of carbon are stored per year.</p>

<p>“The transition between megatons and gigatons is enormous:
the carbon storage industry needs to increase by a factor of 200,”
said Woods. “We will need thousands of carbon injection wells and
subsurface reservoirs by the middle of the century if we’re
going to reach the Paris targets.”</p>

<p>Safe storage of CO2 at depths of 1-2 kilometres beneath permeable
layers of rock is a major research area at the IEEF. Researchers are
studying how CO2 migrates through deep porous rocks to establish
the storage capacity of different geological systems, and how the
CO2 becomes safely trapped.</p>

<p>Researchers are also exploring approaches for monitoring the
migration of CO2 and for optimising the injection strategy.
“This work is having a direct impact on the development of new
storage sites, through close collaboration with industrial
operators,” said Woods.</p>

<h2 id="lowering-emissions-in-cambridge">Lowering emissions in Cambridge</h2>

<p>IEEF researchers are also working on improving access to
geothermal energy through the use of long-reach horizontal
wells, through which water flows by buoyancy forces as it
recovers heat from the subsurface. There are numerous technical
challenges associated with such systems, and they are closely
related to some of the challenges for inter-seasonal heat storage.</p>

<p>Significant amounts of waste thermal energy can be stored below
ground over the summer and recovered in winter. Such approaches
have enormous potential within heat pump schemes. Woods, a
Fellow at St John’s College, has been working with IEEF
researchers to develop a plan to reduce the College’s carbon
emissions associated with heating and powering its historic buildings.</p>

<p>The College plans to replace all its gas heating on the main site
with high-temperature heat pumps. These heat pumps require a
source of thermal energy, and IEEF researchers are exploring
the relative merits of using the River Cam, extracting heat
from boreholes on the Backs or using air heat exchangers.</p>

<p>“Based on the technology we’ve got right now, we estimate we
can reduce the carbon emissions of St John’s College by about
45 percent,” said Woods. “The main reason we can’t reduce it
any further is that the electricity supply in the national
grid has a carbon intensity of about 220 grams per kilowatt
hour, and the heat pumps are powered by this electricity.
As the electricity system becomes decarbonised, the associated
carbon emissions of our heating system will fall.”</p>

<p>IEEF researchers are also working to improve superfast
battery charging systems by speeding up the removal of
associated waste heat; working to improve the performance
of wind turbines by developing new lubricants that can
withstand the extreme conditions inside turbines, thereby
preventing wear but also reducing drag; and working to
retain the CO2 stored in peatlands while preserving
farming capacity, through management of the water table.</p>

<p>“The researchers at the IEEF are working incredibly hard to
develop solutions to support the energy transition, in
collaboration with the companies who will help deliver that
transition,” said Woods. “This is an exciting time for the
University and through pioneering research and collaboration
we can make a material impact in building a zero-carbon world.”</p>
