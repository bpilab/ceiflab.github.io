<p>We will mathematically describe the industrial process of latex glove 
manufacture. Interested students should contact either
<a href="/user/afr10">Alex Routh</a> or
<a href="/user/bg392">Bob Groves</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>We all use latex and nitrile thin gloves. Over 180 billion of them are 
manufactured each year. The method of manufacture involves taking a ceramic 
former and dipping it into a solution of electrolyte, typically calcium 
nitrate. The coated former is dried and then dipped into a bath of dilute, 
aqueous polymer latex. The calcium nitrate (called coagulant) causes the 
latex particles to aggregate onto the former forming a weak, water containing 
film described in the industry as wet gel. Upon removal and subsequent drying 
the film transforms into the glove, which is then removed from the former and 
packaged. We sketch the process in the figure.</p>

<p>We have recently proposed a model where the transport of coagulant into the 
latex bath is driven by diffusion. The wet gel thickness is experimentally 
found to be thinner than that predicted and, after considering many 
mechanisms for the discrepancy, we concluded that a reaction between calcium 
ions and anionic surfactant ions from the latex reduces the calcium 
concentration and hence the wet gel thickness.</p>

<p>Despite its industrial importance, many aspects of thin glove manufacture are 
not yet understood. The application of a better understanding could reduce 
the environmental impact of the process. For example, to obtain a thin final 
film, a large amount of water is used in the initial stage to dilute the 
latex. At the final stage of production, this water is evaporated with a high 
energy cost.</p>

<p>Once we have a refined model, we will be able to predict the glove thickness 
and rate of formation as a function of all process parameters. We will then 
apply our knowledge to a production plant and see how to optimise the 
process. In particular we seek to minimise the energy input to the plant. 
This is likely to involve using a latex dispersion with as high a polymer 
content as possible consistent with producing a thin (&lt; 0.1mm) film, to 
reduce the cost of adding then evaporating water. Consequently we think the 
industrial questions to answer are</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a given set of process parameters what is the energy requirement?</li>
  <li>What are the optimum parameters?</li>
  <li>For higher latex volume fractions how does the glove thickness change?</li>
  <li>Are there other processing issues associated with higher volume fraction latex?</li>
</ul>
