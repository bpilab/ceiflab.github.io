         "title": "About the BPI",
         "content": "Introduction to the BPI \n \nThe BPI is an interdisciplinary research institute in the University of Cambridge, with a focus on fluid mechanics and surface science. Our research spans subjects ranging from volcano dynamics, carbon sequestration, ocean mixing and ice sheet evolution, through to microscopic encapsulation technology, fundamentals of wetting and corrosion, flow in permeable rocks, and most recently granular flows and fluid mechanics for sustainability and the energy transition. It is characterised by the combination of experimental data, theoretical modelling and numerical analysis to enable quantitative description of many complex and often multiphase flow processes. \n \nThe BPI was established in 2000 and has six permanent university faculty, a senior research fellow and a lively cohort of over 30 PhD and Post-Doctoral researchers. We have 5 parent departments in the University: Earth Sciences, Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Engineering. \n \nResearch Impact \n \nOver the past 20 years, research from the BPI has had significant impact in a number of key areas, including the design of low energy ventilation systems for buildings, new insights into carbon sequestration, improved functioning of lubricants, and new encapsulation processes for bio-active washing powders. \n \nAnnual Masterclass \n \nA flagship enterprise of the BPI is the Annual Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand, which has been running for over 17 years and includes lively debate on the energy transition, including presentations and discussion of the technological challenges associated with various sources of energy and challenges on reducing energy demand. \n \nThe BPI was established through an endowment by BP plc in 1999, and over the past 20 years, the BPI has built up very strong links with many partners in both academia and industry, working on problems in the built environment, the energy sector and the environment. \n \n \n",

We have built up considerable expertise on the dynamics of CO2 plumes moving through layered permeable rocks and on the various mechanics which control the trapping of CO2 in the subsurface, including structural, capillary and dissolution. \n \nThere is a large group of researchers exploring some of the fundamental controls of CO2 migration and working on interpreting field data from active CO2 sequestration projects using these models. Ongoing work focuses on the dynamics of CO2 in heterogeneous and permeable rocks, with direct relevance to several reservoirs presently being explored for carbon storage.

In this PhD project, the student will use novel experimental techniques, using photoelasticity and high-speed imagery, and physical modelling to explore the rheological behaviour of laboratory avalanches. Using simplified dynamical models of avalanche flows, we aim to motivate improved construction of safety barriers and other mechanisms to deflect the flow. \n \nContact Nathalie Vriend and Andy Woods \n",

         "content": "Non-covalent interactions: Halogen bonded 2D layers \n \nResearchers: Prof Stuart Clarke \n \nWe have a longstanding and on-going interest in 2D monolayer of molecular materials and their structures. We have investigated a range of intermolecular interactions between the adsorbed molecules from van der Waals interactions, to dipolar species (refs. 1-4). This goes from ubiquitious van der Waals interactions (refs. 5-6) and supramolecular, non-covalent bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding (refs. acids 7-10, amides 11-14, alcohols 15-17) and more recently halogen bonding (refs. 18-21). \n \nSome images below illustrate some of the binary mixture 2D layers held together by halogen bonding. Halogen bonding is an interesting and relatively new interaction very similar is some ways to hydrogen bonding. It is reasonably strong and directional, by is not a permanent covalent bond. As illustrated in the table below, by changing the chemical nature of the components, strong and weak halogen bonds can be found. In the limit of very weak halogen bonds, no co-crystal forms at all. \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n \n  The structure of a bromomethane monolayer adsorbed on graphite S. M. Clarke &amp; R. K.

         "title": "Latex glove dipping",
         "content": "Latex glove dipping \n \nWe will mathematically describe the industrial process of latex glove manufacture. Interested students should contact either Alex Routh or Bob Groves. \n \nBackground \n \nWe all use latex and nitrile thin gloves. Over 180 billion of them are manufactured each year. The method of manufacture involves taking a ceramic former and dipping it into a solution of electrolyte, typically calcium nitrate. The coated former is dried and then dipped into a bath of dilute, aqueous polymer latex. The calcium nitrate (called coagulant) causes the latex particles to aggregate onto the former forming a weak, water containing film described in the industry as wet gel. Upon removal and subsequent drying the film transforms into the glove, which is then removed from the former and packaged. We sketch the process in the figure. \n \nWe have recently proposed a model where the transport of coagulant into the latex bath is driven by diffusion. The wet gel thickness is experimentally found to be thinner than that predicted and, after considering many mechanisms for the discrepancy, we concluded that a reaction between calcium ions and anionic surfactant ions from the latex reduces the calcium concentration and hence the wet gel thickness. \n \nDespite its industrial importance, many aspects of thin glove manufacture are not yet understood. The application of a better understanding could reduce the environmental impact of the process. For example, to obtain a thin final film, a large amount of water is used in the initial stage to dilute the latex. At the final stage of production, this water is evaporated with a high energy cost. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe dipping process of making latex gloves \n \n \n \n \nProposed Project \n \nOnce we have a refined model, we will be able to predict the glove thickness and rate of formation as a function of all process parameters. We will then apply our knowledge to a production plant and see how to optimise the process. In particular we seek to minimise the energy input to the plant. This is likely to involve using a latex dispersion with as high a polymer content as possible consistent with producing a thin (&lt; 0.1mm) film, to reduce the cost of adding then evaporating water. Consequently we think the industrial questions to answer are \n \n \n  For a given set of process parameters what is the energy requirement? \n  What are the optimum parameters? \n  For higher latex volume fractions how does the glove thickness change? \n  Are there other processing issues associated with higher volume fraction latex? \n \n",

         "content": "2D Self-Assembled Layers \n \nResearchers: Prof Stuart Clarke \n \nWe have a long standing interest in the 2D structure of adsorbed molecules. One recent example of this has been 2D crystal layers of a porphyrin adsorbed on graphite. \n \nThe xray diffraction data below shows peaks with a characteristic saw-tooth line shape, indicative of a 2D layer (3D crystals have symmetric peaks). The figure also shows the 2D layer structure, unit cell and the comparison of the experiment and calculated diffraction data, indicating very good agreement. The molecules in the layer are flat on the surface and oriented so that the -OH groups are close to each other. This is a sensible arrangement as it facilitates inter -OH interaction, such as hydrogen bonding. However, this arrangement means that this layer does not follow the close packing rules of Kitaigorodskii as the molecules are not 6-coordinate in this 2D layer. However, this may be due to the hydrogen bonding facilitated by the arrangement that overcomes the simple packing rules. \n \nThese are reported to have applications in many areas including light harvesting. \n \n \n",

For example, as electrodes for supercapacitors where the high effective surface area and well defined pore/channel size can give very high energy storage capacitires. A MOF is usually some organic ligand held together in a lattice by metal ion coordination. \n \nThe figure below illustrates a semi-conducting MOF we have recently prepared with well-defined 1D channels.

A model of a turbulent fountain suggests that after rising 10–20 m above the vent, the erupting particle-laden mixture entrains and mixes with sufficient seawater that it becomes denser than seawater. The momentum of the resulting negatively buoyant fountain is only sufficient to carry the material 50–200 m above the seafloor and much of the solid material then collapses to the seafloor; this will not produce the far-reaching fall deposits observed on the seabed. However, new laboratory experiments show that particle sedimentation at the top of the fountain enables some of the hot, buoyant water in the fountain to separate from the collapsing flow and continue rising as a buoyant plume until it forms a radially spreading intrusion higher in the water column. With eruption rates of 106–107 kg s−1, we estimate that this warm water may rise a few 100’s m above the fountain. Some of the finer grained pyroclasts can be carried upwards by this flow and as they spread out in the radial intrusion, they gradually sediment to form a fall deposit which may extend 1000’s m from the source. Meanwhile, material collapsing from the dense fountain forms aqueous pyroclastic flows which may also spread 1000’s m from the vent forming a flow deposit on the seabed. Quantification of the controls on the concurrent fall and flow deposits, and comparison with field observations, including from the 2012 eruption of Havre Volcano in the South Pacific, open the way to new understanding of submarine eruptions. \n \n \n",

       "content": "Cara James, Nicola Mingotti, Andy Woods \n \nJournal of Fluid Mechanics \n \nWe present new experiments of particle-driven turbulent plumes issuing from a constant source of dense particle-laden fluid, with buoyancy flux, B, in a uniform horizontal current, u. Experiments show that a turbulent, well-mixed plume develops, in which the downward vertical speed w decreases with depth z according to w = 0.76(B/uz)(1/2) while the horizontal speed rapidly asymptotes to the current speed u, provided that the Stokes settling speed of the particles v &lt; 0.92w. For v &gt; 0.92w, the particles separate from the plume fluid, and their depth z increases according to the simple sedimentation trajectory dz/dx = v/u. As the particles sediment, they form clusters of particles, which lead to fluctuations in the particle load with position, but do not appear to change the time-average sedimentation speed. We explore the impact of these results for deep-sea mining, in which the fate of the plume water as well as the particles is key for assessing potential environmental impacts. \n \n \n",

       "content": "Thomas M. McCoy, Alexander J. Armstrong, Jackson E. Moore, Stephen A. Holt, Rico F. Tabor and Alexander F. Routh \n \nPhysical Chemistry Chemical Physics \n \nThe spontaneous adsorption of graphene oxide (GO) sheets at the air–water interface is explored using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements. As a pure aqueous dispersion, GO sheets do not spontaneously adsorb at the air–water interface due to their high negative surface potential (−60 mV) and hydrophilic functionality. However, when incorporated with surfactant molecules at optimal ratios and loadings, GO sheets can spontaneously be driven to the surface. It is hypothesised that surfactant molecules experience favourable attractive interactions with the surfaces of GO sheets, resulting in co-assembly that serves to render the sheets surface active. The GO/surfactant composites then collectively adsorb at the air–water interface, with XRR analysis suggesting an interfacial structure comprising surfactant tailgroups in air and GO/surfactant headgroups in water for a combined thickness of 30–40 Å, depending on the surfactant used. Addition of too much surfactant appears to inhibit GO surface adsorption by saturating the interface, and low loadings of GO/surfactant composites (even at optimal ratios) do not show significant adsorption indicating a partitioning effect. Lastly, surfactant chemistry is also a key factor dictating adsorption capacity of GO. The zwitterionic surfactant oleyl amidopropyl betaine causes marked increases in GO surface activity even at very low concentrations (≤0.2 mM), whereas non-ionic surfactants such as Triton X-100 and hexaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether require higher concentrations (ca. 1 mM) in order to impart spontaneous adsorption of the sheets. Anionic surfactants do not enhance GO surface activity presumably due to like-charge repulsions that prevent co-assembly. This work provides useful insight into the synergy between GO sheets and molecular amphiphiles in aqueous systems for enhancing the surface activity of GO, and can be used to inform system formulation for developing water-friendly, surface active composites based around atomically thin materials. \n \n \n \n \n \nAir–water XRR datasets of different mixtures of TX-100 and GO at (a) different ratios, (b) fixed ratio but different loadings and (c) with different quantitites of NaCl included. \n \n \n \n \n",

       "title": "The BPI and the Energy Transition",
       "content": "The BPI and the Energy Transition \n \nAs you will see from the wide range of research, we have a strong interest in helping to understand the science of climate change, including the work on ice dynamics and ocean mixing, and we have many projects related to the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the energy system, where our work is providing important new insights into new technologies, including CCS, energy storage, low energy building design, wind turbine optimisation. We also hold an annual Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand to which all students in Cambridge can apply to attend - at this we have a host of speakers presenting the facts and data about the present and future energy system, in particular focussing on the technology and other challenges associated with decarbonising the energy system. \n \nThe energy transition requires a large number of scientists and engineers to work with government, industry and society to try to assess and select optimal solutions for a decarbonised energy system. There are many choices and challenges with developing a decarbonised energy supply system and energy supply mix: it needs to have sufficient capacity to supply the energy which the world uses, both presently and going forward and we need to determine the fraction of this energy supply which each technology might contribute (eg wind or solar or geothermal or hydroelectric, or nuclear, …). Also knowledge of the present energy supply system is clearly very important in informing these decisions. On the demand side, there are very many technical challenges to develop new machines and other systems which can be powered by the new energy supply system, which will be largely delivered as electricity, or perhaps as hydrogen - compared to today, where we have a significant amount of energy delivered to the user in the form of natural gas (eg for heating over 20 million homes in the UK) or in petrol or diesel (for powering vehicles) which need to be replaced with electric vehicles or perhaps hydrogen powered vehicles, and alternative heating systems, which might include district heating systems or heat pumps, or other solutions. There are significant natural resource implications if all passenger vehicles become electric, given the large number of new batteries that we would need to manufacture. We also need new solutions for powering cargo ships and air travel. In addition, there are numerous opportunities for more efficient use of energy through new technological solutions, and better design, especially with buildings. Then the cement and steel industries, which are responsible for a significant fraction of global CO2 emissions, may require the development of CCS and the invention of lower carbon manufacturing processes. Finally, biofuels with carbon capture, offer a possible means to achieve negative emissions. \n \nFor all of these problems, there is an enormous amount of important work to be done, on policy and economics as well as the science and engineering, and we are engaged in some of these problems in the BPI. Our hope is that many students and other researchers will join in this major activity to help address both the overarching questions of technology choices moving forward (since there are many different solutions) and the detailed questions which require detailed technical / engineering or research work in each part of the energy system - both relating to the supply and the demand sides, as well as energy efficiency. \n \nAs you will appreciate, industry plays a central role in the energy supply and energy demand systems, and so it is crucial that we collaborate and work constructively with industry across the whole spectrum to help translate our technical innovations into creating the new decarbonised energy system, and also to help influence the choices made by industry going forward using our detailed technical knowledge. As the energy infrastructure undergoes this enormous transition, there is a need for civilised discussion and debate, and the BPI as with other venues in the University, provides an ideal platform for such discussions. \n \nWe all want to evolve to a decarbonised energy system as rapidly as possible, but this is an enormous endeavour, and it will require tremendous innovation and collaboration. \n \nAndy Woods, April 2020 \n",

       "title": "The BPI and Climate Change",
       "content": "Anthropogenic carbon emissions have resulted in a major increase in atmospheric levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, especially methane. This is leading to global warming, through the greenhouse effect and acidification of the oceans. There is therefore a pressing need to reduce future emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In line with this, the UK government have a plan to become net zero by 2050; the University of Cambridge plan to become net zero by 2048. Net zero means that there is no net emission of CO2. \n \n \n \nReducing carbon emissions \n \n \n \nReaching net zero is a major challenge, requiring a re-building of much of the national and international energy infrastructure, and has challenges in the supply and use of energy. The supply needs to change from oil, gas and coal to carbon free sources, which with today’s technologies largely implies new wind and solar power – future technologies may also unlock more of the potential energy in waves, such as tidal and geothermal. Presently over 80% of the world’s energy usage is supplied by fossil fuels, so the transition in the energy supply system is of a truly global scale. While this occurs, energy supply needs to be maintained; given the scale of the transition it is very likely that we will continue to use a significant but gradually diminishing inventory of fossil fuels, as the new renewable supplies come on stream. This future use of fossil fuels will release a substantial amount of greenhouse gases; technologies to reduce these emissions by making fuel production or consumption more efficient will therefore have an important impact on the overall atmospheric carbon levels. \n \n \n \nTechnological challenges \n \n \n \nThe demand for energy spans many different uses, such as heating (for buildings), electricity for power (for use in lighting, powering computers, and other electrical goods), and energy for transport (cars, trucks, trains, ships and planes). Presently, in the UK 22 million homes use natural gas for heating; transitioning to a carbon free heating system will require replacement of all the gas boilers with other systems, such as electrical heat pumps or hydrogen driven heating systems. Transport is centred on petrol and diesel powered cars and trucks, jet fuel for planes and coke for shipping; we need new vehicles powered by carbon free energy sources. Electrical cars provide a replacement for petrol/diesel cars, but large trucks, with substantially greater mass and hence energy needs, may require alternative high density energy sources, such as hydrogen, and there are experiments under way exploring the use of hydrogen to power ships. Electricity is a direct product of wind and solar power, so with enough wind turbines and solar farms the electrical systems become zero carbon. In today’s power generation system, wind and solar do not provide all the electricity, and the electricity derived from natural gas is not carbon free; running electric cars or heat pumps on gas-derived electricity does not remove carbon emissions. Hydrogen could be generated from renewable energy using the electricity to electrolyse water, thereby making the hydrogen a zero carbon fuel. \n \nAnother major challenge of the energy transition is that as well as requiring new infrastructure for both the supply and the demand systems, the electrical grid which transmits the electricity needs a substantial upgrade and redesign if it is to carry the energy for transport and heating as well as the electricity load for its present uses. For context, in the UK, the energy used at present for electricity, for heating and for transport are of comparable scale. \n \nOwing to the enormity of these challenges, another technology which has been discussed and which is included in the IPCC and the UK Committee for Climate Change plans is the process of Carbon Capture and Storage. Carbon Capture and Storage involves the removal of carbon dioxide from the gases produced when fossil fuels are combusted. At a power station, the CO2 can be captured on a large scale and pumped underground into saline aquifers, where the CO2 will displace the water and become trapped. CCS provides a means to prevent addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, while still using natural gas or other fossil fuels to generate electricity, leading to the expression “clean gas”. CCS is however an important technology in its own right, since there are other industrial processes which produce large fluxes of CO2, such as cement manufacture. Using CCS to capture the large flux of CO2 produced at a cement factory or other such site would reduce those emissions into the atmosphere. It is also possible to grow biofuels, which absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and then burn the fuels to produce electricity, while capturing the exhaust gases through CCS. This ultimately leads to negative emissions of CO2, and has been proposed as part of the net zero system for 2050. \n \n \n \nEnergy efficiency \n \n \n \nFinally, an important element of the energy transition is in designing more efficient systems, from small machines, phones and computers, to larger buildings and other infrastructure. Using less energy while maintaining present functionality offers huge opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. \n \nThe BPI is involved in the development of many of the above solutions or topics related to the energy transition. Work is under way to reduce the frictional stresses associated with lubricants, making machines with moving parts more efficient so they use less energy in the first instance. We also have a major programme of research into carbon capture and storage, examining how much CO2 can be injected into a subsurface aquifer, where it will spread in the aquifer, and how we can monitor where the CO2 migrates within the aquifer. Other research in the BPI is directed towards designing low energy buildings, while also keeping the environment in such buildings safe and well ventilated. We have projects exploring the production of batteries with higher energy capacity, and in using aquifers to store thermal energy on a seasonal basis. Some research in the BPI is directed towards understanding the detailed processes which occur in nature as a result of the climate change; we have projects exploring the long term evolution is ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic, modelling deep ocean mixing with a view to providing clearer quantification of the residence time of CO2 adsorbed into the ocean, and work modelling avalanches and landslides which are becoming more frequent owing to changes in vegetation and forest fires as well as other effects. \n \n \n \nTaking up the challenge \n \n \n \nWe welcome mutually respectful debate and discussion about the important issues of climate change and the energy transition, and encourage students to sign up for the annual BPI Masterclass in December. The energy challenge requires a very wide cohort of students and faculty to engage with the multitude of problems associated with driving forward the energy transition, ranging from the science and technology to the design of new policy, and the challenges of the social and economic constraints.
