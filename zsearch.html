         "content": "The Institute for Energy and Environmental Flow \n \nThe Institute carries out interdisciplinary research in the University of \nCambridge, with a focus on fluid mechanics and surface science. Our research \nspans subjects ranging from volcano dynamics, carbon sequestration, ocean \nmixing and ice sheet evolution, through to microscopic encapsulation \ntechnology, fundamentals of wetting and corrosion, flow in permeable rocks, \nand most recently granular flows and fluid mechanics for sustainability and \nthe energy transition. It is characterised by the combination of experimental \ndata, theoretical modelling and numerical analysis to enable quantitative \ndescription of many complex and often multiphase flow processes. \n \nOver the past 20 years, research from the Institute has had \nsignificant impact in a \nnumber of key areas, including the design of low energy ventilation systems \nfor buildings, new insights into carbon sequestration, improved functioning of \nlubricants, and new encapsulation processes for bio-active washing powders. \n \nCambridge Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand \n \nA flagship enterprise of the Institute is the \nCambridge Masterclass, \nwhich has been running for over 17 years and includes \nlively debate on the energy transition, including presentations and discussion \nof the technological challenges associated with various sources of energy and \nchallenges on reducing energy demand. \n \n \n",

We have investigated a range of  \nintermolecular interactions between the adsorbed molecules from van der Waals  \ninteractions, to dipolar species (refs. 1-4). This goes from ubiquitious van  \nder Waals interactions (refs. 5-6) and supramolecular, non-covalent bonding  \ninteractions such as hydrogen bonding (refs. acids 7-10, amides 11-14,  \nalcohols 15-17) and more recently halogen bonding (refs. 18-21). \n \nSome images below illustrate some of the binary mixture 2D layers held  \ntogether by halogen bonding. Halogen bonding is an interesting and relatively  \nnew interaction very similar is some ways to hydrogen bonding. It is  \nreasonably strong and directional, by is not a permanent covalent bond.

He has used his methods to \ninvestigate important phenomena involved in multiphase flows, \nincluding viscoelasticity, surface tension, surfactant, contact line, \ntriplet point, rarefied gas dynamics, droplet collisions and droplet \nimpact on solid walls. \n \nDr. Li’s work in the field of multiphase flows is well recognized: his work was cited more than 2000 times and his h-index is 19. \n \n \n \n \n \nPhotos of an ethanol bubble rising to and interacting with a free surface (experiment by Sunol and Gonzalez-Cinca).

         "title": "Latex glove dipping",
         "content": "Latex glove dipping \n \nWe will mathematically describe the industrial process of latex glove  \nmanufacture. Interested students should contact either \nAlex Routh or \nBob Groves. \n \nBackground \n \nWe all use latex and nitrile thin gloves. Over 180 billion of them are  \nmanufactured each year. The method of manufacture involves taking a ceramic  \nformer and dipping it into a solution of electrolyte, typically calcium  \nnitrate. The coated former is dried and then dipped into a bath of dilute,  \naqueous polymer latex. The calcium nitrate (called coagulant) causes the  \nlatex particles to aggregate onto the former forming a weak, water containing  \nfilm described in the industry as wet gel. Upon removal and subsequent drying  \nthe film transforms into the glove, which is then removed from the former and  \npackaged. We sketch the process in the figure. \n \nWe have recently proposed a model where the transport of coagulant into the  \nlatex bath is driven by diffusion. The wet gel thickness is experimentally  \nfound to be thinner than that predicted and, after considering many  \nmechanisms for the discrepancy, we concluded that a reaction between calcium  \nions and anionic surfactant ions from the latex reduces the calcium  \nconcentration and hence the wet gel thickness. \n \nDespite its industrial importance, many aspects of thin glove manufacture are  \nnot yet understood. The application of a better understanding could reduce  \nthe environmental impact of the process. For example, to obtain a thin final  \nfilm, a large amount of water is used in the initial stage to dilute the  \nlatex. At the final stage of production, this water is evaporated with a high  \nenergy cost. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe dipping process of making latex gloves \n \n \n \n \nProposed Project \n \nOnce we have a refined model, we will be able to predict the glove thickness  \nand rate of formation as a function of all process parameters. We will then  \napply our knowledge to a production plant and see how to optimise the  \nprocess. In particular we seek to minimise the energy input to the plant.  \nThis is likely to involve using a latex dispersion with as high a polymer  \ncontent as possible consistent with producing a thin (&lt; 0.1mm) film, to  \nreduce the cost of adding then evaporating water. Consequently we think the  \nindustrial questions to answer are \n \n \n  For a given set of process parameters what is the energy requirement? \n  What are the optimum parameters? \n  For higher latex volume fractions how does the glove thickness change? \n  Are there other processing issues associated with higher volume fraction latex? \n \n",

The  \nfigure also shows the 2D layer structure, unit cell and the comparison of the  \nexperiment and calculated diffraction data, indicating very good agreement.  \nThe molecules in the layer are flat on the surface and oriented so that the - \nOH groups are close to each other. This is a sensible arrangement as it  \nfacilitates inter -OH interaction, such as hydrogen bonding. However, this  \narrangement means that this layer does not follow the close packing rules of  \nKitaigorodskii as the molecules are not 6-coordinate in this 2D layer.  \nHowever, this may be due to the hydrogen bonding facilitated by the  \narrangement that overcomes the simple packing rules. \n \nThese are reported to have applications in many areas including light  \nharvesting. \n \n \n",

Eventually it may include other biofluids for diagnostic information. \n \nPurpose:  Interpreting structure morphology from deposit to diagnostic \n \nA study of the drying of blood-droplets on prepared substrates with an initial objective of generating a simple, cheap field-diagnostic for anaemia and other disorders, by mapping a haematocrit phase diagram.  The wider objective is to quantify the mechanisms underlying the development of structure within the droplet.  Observations of evaporating sessile droplets of colloidal suspensions have been made using a high-resolution video apparatus, including blood from research donors (NHSBT), blood-substitute (Securacell) and analogues (6 µm rigid polystyrene spheres, 240 nm PMMA nanoparticles) on a range of substrates of varying contact-angle, generating a concentration vs contact-angle phase-diagram. \n \nA new method and apparatus based on image-intensity has allowed tracking of time-evolution deposition profiles via advection of particulates to be studied.   Morphologies include;  ‘coffee-ring’, ‘dimple’ and unusual blood ‘column’ profiles, often terminating in cracking.  The presence of a ‘halting’ compaction front reported in the literature was confirmed.   A characteristic time-evolution of advection-profiles has been identified for what is believed to be the first time, showing a distinct initial peak near the droplet rim collapsing back progressively towards the centre, generating a spectrum of the colloquially-known ‘coffee-ring’ residue-profiles. \n \nThe positional variation of the ‘temporal maximum’ in intensity may provide confirmation of the ‘de-wetting’ status of the compacted structure, and warrants further investigation along with the halting front, and an interesting mode of darkening, which may be related to the porosity of the bed, and refraction at the surface menisci exposed on the droplet. \n \n \n \nResearch Interests \n \nBlood drying \n \n \n",

       "title": "BP Institute to be renamed the Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows",
       "content": "The change of name better reflects the scope of the Institute’s research  \nwhich for several years has been focused on the energy transition and  \nenvironmental sustainability. The University of Cambridge will continue to  \nwork with carefully selected partners from across the energy sector on  \nresearch to support the global energy transition. \n \nThe University of Cambridge has decided to rename the BP Institute. It will  \nnow be called the Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows. This  \ndecision has been made to better reflect the scope of the Institute’s  \nresearch and its focus on energy transition. By changing its name the  \nInstitute hopes to prevent misunderstandings about its research work, promote  \nfurther interdisciplinary collaboration, and facilitate more diverse  \nfundraising externally. \n \nProfessor Andy Woods, Director of the Institute, said:  \n“The researchers in the Institute are working to develop the scientific and technical solutions we need to support the energy transition, from enabling superfast battery charging systems and improving the performance of wind turbines, to the decarbonisation of heating systems and improving the efficiency and safety of carbon storage techniques. This name change reflects the breadth of research carried out at the Institute, as we continue to build a low-carbon economy.” \n \nThe Institute’s research projects now cover a wide range of technologies that support both the energy transition and environmental sustainability: \n \n \n  modelling decarbonisation of buildings (for example, St John’s College, Cambridge); \n  investigating heat transfer to enable superfast battery charging and research into optimising the power generated from arrays of wind turbines; \n  investigating the fluid mechanics of carbon storage in deep saline aquifers, a key strand of the IPCC strategy to reach the 1.5C target; \n  new models for bubble release from electrolysers to improve their efficiency, a key challenge for the use of hydrogen to store energy; \n  models for the dispersal of particles through the ocean to better understand the environmental impact of deep sea mining. \n \n \nThe proposed name also emphasises the independence of the Institute’s research: the Institute publishes more than 50 papers a year in leading international journals. \n \nThe Institute will continue to receive funding from BP for projects that address shared goals related to the energy transition, but as with any project no partner is able to direct research. As part of this commitment to tackling climate change, the University engages with carefully chosen partners across the energy sector whose specialist skills, expertise and access to global markets can help significantly accelerate towards Net Zero. Collaboration with our energy sector partners accelerates global energy transition in a number of ways, including: \n \nAccess to expertise across a global energy distribution network, which delivers power into the mobile phone in your pocket, or the electric car charging on the street. \nExperience across a diverse range of engineering, chemical and technical disciplines which provides the University with the global scale required to realise the tangible outcome of our research. \n \nProfessor Andy Neely, Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor \n(Enterprise and Business Relations), said: \n‘The decision to rename the Institute was made to better reflect the \nresearch carried out at the Institute and be clear about its independence. \n \n‘Presently, the world’s energy system is dominated by fossil fuels, and while an energy transition is urgent, it is not possible at the pace and scale required without the current industry’s involvement and willingness to transition. Working with carefully chosen partners from the energy sector on energy transition projects is necessary to develop replacements at a scale that can generate the energy the world needs without a sudden disruption to the global economy that would plunge billions of people into darkness and disrupt vital networks of trade and humanitarian support.’ \n \n \n",

       "content": "Decarbonisation of the energy system is the greatest challenge we face. \nAt Cambridge’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows, \nworld-leading researchers in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and \nsurface science are working to develop the solutions we need to \nreplace fossil fuels and protect our planet. \n \nAfter an extremely hot, dry summer in the UK, where records were broken \nonce again, many of us are realising that climate change isn’t some \nfar-off possibility: it’s already here. To protect our planet for \ncurrent and future generations, we need solutions now. \n \nThere is hope, however: there are options in all sectors to \nsignificantly reduce carbon emissions. Huge cost and efficiency \nimprovements in wind and solar power are building up the renewable \nsupply of electricity, but the associated intermittency requires \nsubstantial energy storage infrastructure to replace the gas-fired \npower stations which cushion against this intermittency. \n \nOther industries, such as global shipping, aviation, cement, \nfertiliser, and iron and steel require radical solutions, including \nthe possible use of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technology. \n \n“We need to transition our economy to low carbon sources of power \nas a matter of urgency,” said Professor Andy Woods. \n“Universities like Cambridge are working hard to develop the \nscience and technology to underpin this industrial revolution, \nin collaboration with industry.” \n \nWoods is Director of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Flows \n(IEEF). The Institute was established at Cambridge in 2000, and was \ninitially known as the BP Institute. The IEEF’s researchers work with \nacademic and industrial collaborators from around the world, using \nfluid mechanics, thermodynamics and surface science to help with \nsome of the major challenges for decarbonisation including \ngeological carbon storage, superfast battery charging, efficient \nbuilding heating systems and lubricants which reduce drag. \n \nDeveloping solutions with industry \n \nThe Institute’s researchers also study ocean mixing dynamics, \nfocusing on the timescales of carbon storage, and environmental \nchallenges including avalanche dynamics and explosive volcanic \neruptions, as well as the fluid mechanical processes controlling \nthe melting polar ice. \n \nThe Institute collaborates on energy transition projects with \nenergy companies, including BP and Shell, who are investing \nheavily in the energy transition, including the development of \nwind farms, carbon storage reservoirs, geothermal energy extraction, \nand hydrogen production: all of which are key components of a \ndecarbonised energy system. \n \n“Direct collaboration with industry ensures we can contribute to the \ncritical technical challenges associated with these energy solutions,” \nsaid Woods. “For example, our work on carbon storage is helping \naddress both the regulatory and environmental challenges to ensure \nsafe geological storage, and to maximise the efficiency of the \ninfrastructure needed for carbon storage.” \n \nStoring CO2 underground \n \nAccording to the latest IEA and IPCC projections, to reach the \n1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement by 2050, the world needs to \ncapture and store between 7 and 8 gigatons of CO2 per year, \nnearly one-quarter of present global emissions. This will be \nsourced from cement, iron and steel, and fertiliser production \nas well as from the emerging industry of direct air capture, \nincluding biofuels. Currently, just 40 megatons of carbon are stored per year. \n \n“The transition between megatons and gigatons is enormous: \nthe carbon storage industry needs to increase by a factor of 200,” \nsaid Woods. “We will need thousands of carbon injection wells and \nsubsurface reservoirs by the middle of the century if we’re \ngoing to reach the Paris targets.” \n \nSafe storage of CO2 at depths of 1-2 kilometres beneath permeable \nlayers of rock is a major research area at the IEEF. Researchers are \nstudying how CO2 migrates through deep porous rocks to establish \nthe storage capacity of different geological systems, and how the \nCO2 becomes safely trapped. \n \nResearchers are also exploring approaches for monitoring the \nmigration of CO2 and for optimising the injection strategy. \n“This work is having a direct impact on the development of new \nstorage sites, through close collaboration with industrial \noperators,” said Woods. \n \nLowering emissions in Cambridge \n \nIEEF researchers are also working on improving access to \ngeothermal energy through the use of long-reach horizontal \nwells, through which water flows by buoyancy forces as it \nrecovers heat from the subsurface. There are numerous technical \nchallenges associated with such systems, and they are closely \nrelated to some of the challenges for inter-seasonal heat storage. \n \nSignificant amounts of waste thermal energy can be stored below \nground over the summer and recovered in winter. Such approaches \nhave enormous potential within heat pump schemes. Woods, a \nFellow at St John’s College, has been working with IEEF \nresearchers to develop a plan to reduce the College’s carbon \nemissions associated with heating and powering its historic buildings. \n \nThe College plans to replace all its gas heating on the main site \nwith high-temperature heat pumps. These heat pumps require a \nsource of thermal energy, and IEEF researchers are exploring \nthe relative merits of using the River Cam, extracting heat \nfrom boreholes on the Backs or using air heat exchangers. \n \n“Based on the technology we’ve got right now, we estimate we \ncan reduce the carbon emissions of St John’s College by about \n45 percent,” said Woods. “The main reason we can’t reduce it \nany further is that the electricity supply in the national \ngrid has a carbon intensity of about 220 grams per kilowatt \nhour, and the heat pumps are powered by this electricity. \nAs the electricity system becomes decarbonised, the associated \ncarbon emissions of our heating system will fall.” \n \nIEEF researchers are also working to improve superfast \nbattery charging systems by speeding up the removal of \nassociated waste heat; working to improve the performance \nof wind turbines by developing new lubricants that can \nwithstand the extreme conditions inside turbines, thereby \npreventing wear but also reducing drag; and working to \nretain the CO2 stored in peatlands while preserving \nfarming capacity, through management of the water table. \n \n“The researchers at the IEEF are working incredibly hard to \ndevelop solutions to support the energy transition, in \ncollaboration with the companies who will help deliver that \ntransition,” said Woods. “This is an exciting time for the \nUniversity and through pioneering research and collaboration \nwe can make a material impact in building a zero-carbon world.” \n \n \n",

       "content": "Eric Newland, Nicola Mingotti, \nAndy Woods \n \nScientific Reports \n \nDeposits from explosive submarine eruptions have been found in the deep sea, \n1–4 km below the surface, with both flow and fall deposits extending several \nkm’s over the seafloor. A model of a turbulent fountain suggests that after \nrising 10–20 m above the vent, the erupting particle-laden mixture entrains \nand mixes with sufficient seawater that it becomes denser than seawater. The \nmomentum of the resulting negatively buoyant fountain is only sufficient to \ncarry the material 50–200 m above the seafloor and much of the solid material \nthen collapses to the seafloor; this will not produce the far-reaching fall \ndeposits observed on the seabed. However, new laboratory experiments show \nthat particle sedimentation at the top of the fountain enables some of the \nhot, buoyant water in the fountain to separate from the collapsing flow and \ncontinue rising as a buoyant plume until it forms a radially spreading \nintrusion higher in the water column. With eruption rates of 106–107 kg \ns−1, we estimate that this warm water may rise a few 100’s m above \nthe fountain. Some of the finer grained pyroclasts can be carried upwards by \nthis flow and as they spread out in the radial intrusion, they gradually \nsediment to form a fall deposit which may extend 1000’s m from the source. \nMeanwhile, material collapsing from the dense fountain forms aqueous \npyroclastic flows which may also spread 1000’s m from the vent forming a flow \ndeposit on the seabed. Quantification of the controls on the concurrent fall \nand flow deposits, and comparison with field observations, including from the \n2012 eruption of Havre Volcano in the South Pacific, open the way to new \nunderstanding of submarine eruptions. \n \n \n",

We have performed \nexperiments investigating the formation and growth of underwater dunes from an \ninitially flat bed of sediment. In particular, we vary the speed of the flow, \nthe depth of the water and the thickness of the sediment bed. We observe that \nthe dunes initially grow rapidly, before reaching an almost-constant height \nthat increases with the sediment thickness. In order to relate the initial \ndune growth rate to the driving flow, we have also performed numerical \nsimulations of the water flow in the experiment. This enables us to better \nconstrain the shear stress on the sediment bed, which is quantified through \nthe friction velocity u∗. By combining the experimental and \nnumerical results, we show that the initial dune growth rate is approximately \nproportional to u∗5.

       "content": "Chloé Michaut, Jerome A. Neufeld \n \nJournal of Fluid Mechanics \n \nThe discovery of primitive lunar anorthosites by the Apollo 11 mission was \nsurprising. Their global distribution and purity suggested flotation of \nanorthite crystals over a liquid magma ocean. Flotation theory elegantly \nexplains early formation of the Highlands and the Procellarum KREEP terrane \ncomposition, interpreted as the residual liquid from crystallization, enriched \nin incompatible elements. Since then, many lunar meteorites have been analyzed \nand the lunar surface has been studied remotely. Lunar anorthosites appear \nmore heterogenous in composition than suggested by ferroan anorthosite samples \nonly, contradicting the classical flotation scenario where the liquid ocean is \nthe common source of all anorthosites. The ∼300 Ma age range for ferroan \nanorthosites also appears difficult to reconcile with a mostly liquid ocean. A \nreevaluation of the magma ocean solidification history thus seems necessary. \nIn the low lunar gravity, efficient crystal-liquid separation may be difficult \nto achieve. Here, we investigate the case where a slushy crystal suspension \npersists throughout magma ocean solidification and the crust instead forms by \nextraction of melts enriched in an anorthite component. Crustal magmatism then \nproduced the lunar anorthosites, explaining their observed diversity. The \ncrust formation timescale is several hundreds of million years, matching the \nobserved age range of lunar anorthosites. \n \n \n",

Routh \n \nPhysical Chemistry Chemical Physics \n \nThe spontaneous adsorption of graphene oxide (GO) sheets at the air–water \ninterface is explored using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements. As a pure \naqueous dispersion, GO sheets do not spontaneously adsorb at the air–water \ninterface due to their high negative surface potential (−60 mV) and \nhydrophilic functionality. However, when incorporated with surfactant \nmolecules at optimal ratios and loadings, GO sheets can spontaneously be \ndriven to the surface. It is hypothesised that surfactant molecules \nexperience favourable attractive interactions with the surfaces of GO sheets, \nresulting in co-assembly that serves to render the sheets surface active. The \nGO/surfactant composites then collectively adsorb at the air–water interface, \nwith XRR analysis suggesting an interfacial structure comprising surfactant \ntailgroups in air and GO/surfactant headgroups in water for a combined \nthickness of 30–40 Å, depending on the surfactant used. Addition of too much \nsurfactant appears to inhibit GO surface adsorption by saturating the \ninterface, and low loadings of GO/surfactant composites (even at optimal \nratios) do not show significant adsorption indicating a partitioning effect. \nLastly, surfactant chemistry is also a key factor dictating adsorption \ncapacity of GO. The zwitterionic surfactant oleyl amidopropyl betaine causes \nmarked increases in GO surface activity even at very low concentrations (≤0.2 \nmM), whereas non-ionic surfactants such as Triton X-100 and \nhexaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether require higher concentrations (ca. 1 mM) \nin order to impart spontaneous adsorption of the sheets. Anionic surfactants \ndo not enhance GO surface activity presumably due to like-charge repulsions \nthat prevent co-assembly. This work provides useful insight into the synergy \nbetween GO sheets and molecular amphiphiles in aqueous systems for enhancing \nthe surface activity of GO, and can be used to inform system formulation for \ndeveloping water-friendly, surface active composites based around atomically \nthin materials. \n \n \n \n \n \nAir–water XRR datasets of different mixtures of TX-100 and GO at \n   (a) different ratios, (b) fixed ratio but different loadings and (c) with \n   different quantitites of NaCl included. \n \n \n \n \n",
