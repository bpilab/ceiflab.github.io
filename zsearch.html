         "content": "The Centre for Environmental and Industrial Flow \n \nCEIF is an interdisciplinary research institute in the University of Cambridge, with a focus on fluid mechanics and surface science. Our research spans subjects ranging from volcano dynamics, carbon sequestration, ocean mixing and ice sheet evolution, through to microscopic encapsulation technology, fundamentals of wetting and corrosion, flow in permeable rocks, and most recently granular flows and fluid mechanics for sustainability and the energy transition. It is characterised by the combination of experimental data, theoretical modelling and numerical analysis to enable quantitative description of many complex and often multiphase flow processes. \n \nResearch Impact \n \nOver the past 20 years, research from CEIF has had significant impact in a number of key areas, including the design of low energy ventilation systems for buildings, new insights into carbon sequestration, improved functioning of lubricants, and new encapsulation processes for bio-active washing powders. \n \nAnnual Masterclass \n \nA flagship enterprise of CEIF is the Annual Masterclass in Energy Supply and Demand, which has been running for over 17 years and includes lively debate on the energy transition, including presentations and discussion of the technological challenges associated with various sources of energy and challenges on reducing energy demand. \n \n \n",

We have built up considerable expertise on the dynamics of CO2 plumes moving through layered permeable rocks and on the various mechanics which control the trapping of CO2 in the subsurface, including structural, capillary and dissolution. \n \nThere is a large group of researchers exploring some of the fundamental controls of CO2 migration and working on interpreting field data from active CO2 sequestration projects using these models. Ongoing work focuses on the dynamics of CO2 in heterogeneous and permeable rocks, with direct relevance to several reservoirs presently being explored for carbon storage.

In this PhD project, the student will use novel experimental techniques, using photoelasticity and high-speed imagery, and physical modelling to explore the rheological behaviour of laboratory avalanches. Using simplified dynamical models of avalanche flows, we aim to motivate improved construction of safety barriers and other mechanisms to deflect the flow. \n \nContact Nathalie Vriend and Andy Woods \n",

         "content": "Non-covalent interactions: Halogen bonded 2D layers \n \nResearchers: Prof Stuart Clarke \n \nWe have a longstanding and on-going interest in 2D monolayer of molecular materials and their structures. We have investigated a range of intermolecular interactions between the adsorbed molecules from van der Waals interactions, to dipolar species (refs. 1-4). This goes from ubiquitious van der Waals interactions (refs. 5-6) and supramolecular, non-covalent bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding (refs. acids 7-10, amides 11-14, alcohols 15-17) and more recently halogen bonding (refs. 18-21). \n \nSome images below illustrate some of the binary mixture 2D layers held together by halogen bonding. Halogen bonding is an interesting and relatively new interaction very similar is some ways to hydrogen bonding. It is reasonably strong and directional, by is not a permanent covalent bond. As illustrated in the table below, by changing the chemical nature of the components, strong and weak halogen bonds can be found. In the limit of very weak halogen bonds, no co-crystal forms at all. \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n \n  The structure of a bromomethane monolayer adsorbed on graphite S. M. Clarke &amp; R. K.

         "title": "Latex glove dipping",
         "content": "Latex glove dipping \n \nWe will mathematically describe the industrial process of latex glove manufacture. Interested students should contact either Alex Routh or Bob Groves. \n \nBackground \n \nWe all use latex and nitrile thin gloves. Over 180 billion of them are manufactured each year. The method of manufacture involves taking a ceramic former and dipping it into a solution of electrolyte, typically calcium nitrate. The coated former is dried and then dipped into a bath of dilute, aqueous polymer latex. The calcium nitrate (called coagulant) causes the latex particles to aggregate onto the former forming a weak, water containing film described in the industry as wet gel. Upon removal and subsequent drying the film transforms into the glove, which is then removed from the former and packaged. We sketch the process in the figure. \n \nWe have recently proposed a model where the transport of coagulant into the latex bath is driven by diffusion. The wet gel thickness is experimentally found to be thinner than that predicted and, after considering many mechanisms for the discrepancy, we concluded that a reaction between calcium ions and anionic surfactant ions from the latex reduces the calcium concentration and hence the wet gel thickness. \n \nDespite its industrial importance, many aspects of thin glove manufacture are not yet understood. The application of a better understanding could reduce the environmental impact of the process. For example, to obtain a thin final film, a large amount of water is used in the initial stage to dilute the latex. At the final stage of production, this water is evaporated with a high energy cost. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe dipping process of making latex gloves \n \n \n \n \nProposed Project \n \nOnce we have a refined model, we will be able to predict the glove thickness and rate of formation as a function of all process parameters. We will then apply our knowledge to a production plant and see how to optimise the process. In particular we seek to minimise the energy input to the plant. This is likely to involve using a latex dispersion with as high a polymer content as possible consistent with producing a thin (&lt; 0.1mm) film, to reduce the cost of adding then evaporating water. Consequently we think the industrial questions to answer are \n \n \n  For a given set of process parameters what is the energy requirement? \n  What are the optimum parameters? \n  For higher latex volume fractions how does the glove thickness change? \n  Are there other processing issues associated with higher volume fraction latex? \n \n",

         "content": "2D Self-Assembled Layers \n \nResearchers: Prof Stuart Clarke \n \nWe have a long standing interest in the 2D structure of adsorbed molecules. One recent example of this has been 2D crystal layers of a porphyrin adsorbed on graphite. \n \nThe xray diffraction data below shows peaks with a characteristic saw-tooth line shape, indicative of a 2D layer (3D crystals have symmetric peaks). The figure also shows the 2D layer structure, unit cell and the comparison of the experiment and calculated diffraction data, indicating very good agreement. The molecules in the layer are flat on the surface and oriented so that the -OH groups are close to each other. This is a sensible arrangement as it facilitates inter -OH interaction, such as hydrogen bonding. However, this arrangement means that this layer does not follow the close packing rules of Kitaigorodskii as the molecules are not 6-coordinate in this 2D layer. However, this may be due to the hydrogen bonding facilitated by the arrangement that overcomes the simple packing rules. \n \nThese are reported to have applications in many areas including light harvesting. \n \n \n",

       "content": "Eric Newland, Nicola Mingotti, Andy Woods \n \nScientific Reports \n \nDeposits from explosive submarine eruptions have been found in the deep sea, 1–4 km below the surface, with both flow and fall deposits extending several km’s over the seafloor. A model of a turbulent fountain suggests that after rising 10–20 m above the vent, the erupting particle-laden mixture entrains and mixes with sufficient seawater that it becomes denser than seawater. The momentum of the resulting negatively buoyant fountain is only sufficient to carry the material 50–200 m above the seafloor and much of the solid material then collapses to the seafloor; this will not produce the far-reaching fall deposits observed on the seabed. However, new laboratory experiments show that particle sedimentation at the top of the fountain enables some of the hot, buoyant water in the fountain to separate from the collapsing flow and continue rising as a buoyant plume until it forms a radially spreading intrusion higher in the water column. With eruption rates of 106–107 kg s−1, we estimate that this warm water may rise a few 100’s m above the fountain. Some of the finer grained pyroclasts can be carried upwards by this flow and as they spread out in the radial intrusion, they gradually sediment to form a fall deposit which may extend 1000’s m from the source. Meanwhile, material collapsing from the dense fountain forms aqueous pyroclastic flows which may also spread 1000’s m from the vent forming a flow deposit on the seabed. Quantification of the controls on the concurrent fall and flow deposits, and comparison with field observations, including from the 2012 eruption of Havre Volcano in the South Pacific, open the way to new understanding of submarine eruptions. \n \n \n",

       "content": "P. A. Jarvis, K. A. Bacik, C. Narteau, N. M. Vriend \n \nJournal of Fluid Mechanics \n \nIf the flow of water over a flat bed of sand is sufficiently fast, then grains of sand can be picked up, transported and deposited to form sand dunes. Initially, many small dunes form but, as the flow continues, they grow and merge to become a smaller number of larger dunes. We have performed experiments investigating the formation and growth of underwater dunes from an initially flat bed of sediment. In particular, we vary the speed of the flow, the depth of the water and the thickness of the sediment bed. We observe that the dunes initially grow rapidly, before reaching an almost-constant height that increases with the sediment thickness. In order to relate the initial dune growth rate to the driving flow, we have also performed numerical simulations of the water flow in the experiment. This enables us to better-constrain the shear stress on the sediment bed, which is quantified through the friction velocity u∗. By combining the experimental and numerical results, we show that the initial dune growth rate is approximately proportional to u∗5. These results can form a starting point for models describing the growth of underwater dunes. \n \n \n",

       "content": "Chloé Michaut, Jerome A. Neufeld \n \nJournal of Fluid Mechanics \n \nThe discovery of primitive lunar anorthosites by the Apollo 11 mission was surprising. Their global distribution and purity suggested flotation of anorthite crystals over a liquid magma ocean. Flotation theory elegantly explains early formation of the Highlands and the Procellarum KREEP terrane composition, interpreted as the residual liquid from crystallization, enriched in incompatible elements. Since then, many lunar meteorites have been analyzed and the lunar surface has been studied remotely. Lunar anorthosites appear more heterogenous in composition than suggested by ferroan anorthosite samples only, contradicting the classical flotation scenario where the liquid ocean is the common source of all anorthosites. The ∼300 Ma age range for ferroan anorthosites also appears difficult to reconcile with a mostly liquid ocean. A reevaluation of the magma ocean solidification history thus seems necessary. In the low lunar gravity, efficient crystal-liquid separation may be difficult to achieve. Here, we investigate the case where a slushy crystal suspension persists throughout magma ocean solidification and the crust instead forms by extraction of melts enriched in an anorthite component. Crustal magmatism then produced the lunar anorthosites, explaining their observed diversity. The crust formation timescale is several hundreds of million years, matching the observed age range of lunar anorthosites. \n \n \n",

Experiments show that a turbulent, well-mixed plume develops, in which the downward vertical speed w decreases with depth z according to w = 0.76(B/uz)(1/2) while the horizontal speed rapidly asymptotes to the current speed u, provided that the Stokes settling speed of the particles v &lt; 0.92w. For v &gt; 0.92w, the particles separate from the plume fluid, and their depth z increases according to the simple sedimentation trajectory dz/dx = v/u. As the particles sediment, they form clusters of particles, which lead to fluctuations in the particle load with position, but do not appear to change the time-average sedimentation speed. We explore the impact of these results for deep-sea mining, in which the fate of the plume water as well as the particles is key for assessing potential environmental impacts. \n \n \n",

       "content": "Thomas M. McCoy, Alexander J. Armstrong, Jackson E. Moore, Stephen A. Holt, Rico F. Tabor and Alexander F. Routh \n \nPhysical Chemistry Chemical Physics \n \nThe spontaneous adsorption of graphene oxide (GO) sheets at the air–water interface is explored using X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements. As a pure aqueous dispersion, GO sheets do not spontaneously adsorb at the air–water interface due to their high negative surface potential (−60 mV) and hydrophilic functionality. However, when incorporated with surfactant molecules at optimal ratios and loadings, GO sheets can spontaneously be driven to the surface. It is hypothesised that surfactant molecules experience favourable attractive interactions with the surfaces of GO sheets, resulting in co-assembly that serves to render the sheets surface active. The GO/surfactant composites then collectively adsorb at the air–water interface, with XRR analysis suggesting an interfacial structure comprising surfactant tailgroups in air and GO/surfactant headgroups in water for a combined thickness of 30–40 Å, depending on the surfactant used. Addition of too much surfactant appears to inhibit GO surface adsorption by saturating the interface, and low loadings of GO/surfactant composites (even at optimal ratios) do not show significant adsorption indicating a partitioning effect. Lastly, surfactant chemistry is also a key factor dictating adsorption capacity of GO. The zwitterionic surfactant oleyl amidopropyl betaine causes marked increases in GO surface activity even at very low concentrations (≤0.2 mM), whereas non-ionic surfactants such as Triton X-100 and hexaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether require higher concentrations (ca. 1 mM) in order to impart spontaneous adsorption of the sheets. Anionic surfactants do not enhance GO surface activity presumably due to like-charge repulsions that prevent co-assembly. This work provides useful insight into the synergy between GO sheets and molecular amphiphiles in aqueous systems for enhancing the surface activity of GO, and can be used to inform system formulation for developing water-friendly, surface active composites based around atomically thin materials. \n \n \n \n \n \nAir–water XRR datasets of different mixtures of TX-100 and GO at (a) different ratios, (b) fixed ratio but different loadings and (c) with different quantitites of NaCl included. \n \n \n \n \n",
